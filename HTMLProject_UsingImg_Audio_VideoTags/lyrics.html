No matter what you hit on
Make sure you don't slip on
Anything that makes you get a bad trip on
Open up, lock on, don't be stuck on
The road is always popping
When I walk on with a MAC on
I'm a traveler (hey, hey), time traveler
Center at the star, 'til the center of a nebula
Traveler, time traveler
Center at the star, 'til the center of a nebula
Gonna go nirvana
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Driving in my vimaana
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Wanna go nirvana?
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'll take you in my vimaana
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Vroom vroom in a car (ha)
Vroom vroom on a bike (hey)
Zoom zoom on a train (hey)
And zoom zoom on a flight
Vroom vroom in a car (ha)
Vroom vroom on a bike
Zoom zoom on a train
And zoom zoom on a flight (ah)
Ali Baba played the tabula, bring it like a smuggler
Bubbler of the molecular, I can be your leveller
Saw on me on the Tumblr, are you single, I'm a Tamilar
Love like a snuggler, like Sita and Rama
Talking about Shiva, the queen of Sheba (ha)
From Ethiopia in the time of Pangea
Walk to India, keep it on the linear
Go to Sri Lanka, Vavuniya to Virginia
I'm a traveler (hey, hey), time traveler (hey, hey)
Center at the star, 'til the center of a nebula
Traveler, time traveler (hey, hey)
Center at the star, 'til the center of a nebula (hey)
Gonna go nirvana
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Driving in my vimaana
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Wanna go nirvana?
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'll take you in my vimaana
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Vroom vroom in a car (ha)
Vroom vroom on a bike (hey)
Zoom zoom on a train (hey)
And zoom zoom on a flight
Vroom vroom in a car (ha)
Vroom vroom on a bike
Zoom zoom on a train
And zoom zoom on a flight (ah)
Carangi like Gia, pretty like a deer
Throw that sphere, destroy that fear (woo)
Carangi like Gia, pretty like a deer
Throw that sphere, destroy that fear
Intercellular, they say, "Are you Tamilar?"
I say, "I'm a traveler pretending to be a regular"
In the realms of Himalaya you don't need a fibula (woo)
When I flow around I'm racy like Formula (woo)
I'm a traveler, time traveler (woo)
(Woo, woo, woo, woo)
Center at the star, 'til the center of a nebula (hey, hey, hey)
Traveler, time traveler (woo, hey, woo)
Center at the star, 'til the center of a nebula (hey)
Gonna go nirvana
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Driving in my vimaana
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Wanna go nirvana?
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'll take you in my vimaana
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Vroom vroom in a car (ha)
Vroom vroom on a bike (hey)
Zoom zoom on a train (hey)
And zoom zoom on a flight
Vroom vroom in a car (ha)
Vroom vroom on a bike
Zoom zoom on a train
And zoom zoom on a flight (ah)
Woo
Woo
