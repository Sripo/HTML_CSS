# HTML_CSS
Trying to add my learnings of HTML and CSS.

## **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** 
HTML defines the basic structure of a website, similar to the skeleton of a webpage.

### Basic HTML Tags
- `<html></html>`, `<head></head>`, `<body></body>`: These are the fundamental tags required in any `index.html` file.
- `<title></title>`: Defines the text that will be visible in the browser tab or window title.
- `<!-- -->`: Used to insert comments in the code that wonâ€™t be displayed on the webpage.
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Heading tags. `<h1>` is the largest and `<h6>` the smallest.
- `<p></p>`: Defines a paragraph of text.
- `<pre></pre>`: Preserves the format of the text, including spaces, line breaks, and indentation.

### Anchor Tags (Hyperlinks)
- `<a></a>`: Anchor tags create hyperlinks. Attributes include:
  - **`href`**: Specifies the URL or path to the linked document. There are two types of URLs:
    - **Absolute URL**: Full web address starting with the protocol (e.g., `http://` or `https://`), pointing to a specific location on the internet.
    - **Relative URL**: A path relative to the current page or website (e.g., linking to another HTML or CSS file within the project).
  - **`target="_blank"`**: Opens the linked document in a new tab.
  - **`title`**: Displays additional information when you hover over the link.

### Audio and Video Tags
- Both `<audio>` and `<video>` tags are used to embed media on a webpage. The common attributes for both tags are:
  - `controls`: Displays playback controls (e.g., play, pause, volume).
  - `autoplay`: Automatically plays the media once the page loads.
  - `muted`: Mutes the media on load; the user can manually unmute it.
  - `loop`: Repeats the media continuously.

### Self-Closing Tags
- `<br>`: Inserts a line break.
- `<hr>`: Inserts a horizontal line.
- `<img>`: Adds images to the webpage, with attributes such as:
  - `src`: Specifies the image source.
  - `alt`: Alternative text for the image, used for accessibility or when the image fails to load.
  - `height`, `width`: Set the dimensions of the image.
 
### Text Formatting
-`<b></b>` : used to bold the text (i.e, `<b> Bold </b>)
-

## **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** 
CSS adds style to a web page, acting as the decoration, design, and color of the webpage's "interior."
